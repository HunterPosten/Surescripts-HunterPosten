Hello and thanks again for considering my application for the Software Engineer internship at Surescripts.
For my code sample I included two folders, the first one includes the code for one of my homework assignments completed for my
Object Oriented Programming and Design class. I decided that it was important to include this assignment because I feel that 
it not only it displays my handle of object oriented programming but it also demonstrates my programming style.

The second folder "Current Project" contains a couple of classes from a current project that I'm working on. In this project
I am working to create a system that will allow my to send and recieve files over my home network. While these classes are still 
unfinished I wanted to include them because they show that I am working with more advanced topics such as sending and recieving 
packets through multicast sockets.
